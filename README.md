# Task-Manager

Full-stack task management app that provides a responsive interface where
users can **create**, **view**, and **update** tasks, while the backend handles data storage and task status management.

**Front-end** built with **React** and **TypeScript**, using React Hooks and a component-based architecture to provide a responsive experience.

**Back-end** developed with **Node.js** and **Express**, handling all **API requests** for task creation, retrieval, and status updates.

Tasks are stored and managed in a **MongoDB database**.
